# UBEM
This is an urban building energy model scripted in Python.


This model is developed under the research project for "Activity-Based Urban Building and Mobility Energy Modeling (UBMEM) for Planning of Future Cities" funded by the Swedish Energy Agency.

If the model is used for research purposes, please make sure that the citation is properly done. To cite:

UBEM.py is a collection of functions and classes that can be used for modeling and simulation of buildings at different spatial and temporal resolutions.


Requirements

To run the model, make sure that the required tools and packages are already installed on your computer.

1.EnergyPlus: https://github.com/NREL/EnergyPlus/releases/tag/v9.2.0

Python (you can use Anaconda and Spyder to run the model): https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution
3.EPPY: https://pypi.org/project/eppy/

4.geopandas: https://geopandas.org/en/stable/getting_started.html

5.shapely: https://pypi.org/project/shapley/

6. Other packages that might be needed:
fiona
io
itertools
math
matplotlib
multiprocessing
numpy
openpyxl
pandas
pyproj
rtree
time


After the installation is completed, open the "UBEM.py" file and run the codes.

If the model starts running, you should be able to see this on the consol:

SIMULATION IS RUNNING ...

Building 0 / 82

C:\EnergyPlusV9-2-0\energyplus.exe --weather X:\UBEM\input_data\SWE_Stockholm.Arlanda.024600_IWEC.epw --output-directory X:\UBEM --idd C:/EnergyPlusV9-2-0/Energy+.idd X:\UBEM\in.idf *

It is going to take about a few seconds to run the simulation for each building. In the given example file, there are 82 buildings.

After the simulation is completed, an excel file with all the results can be found in the results folder.
